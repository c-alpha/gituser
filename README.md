# gituser - Set the user id in a git working copy quickly when using `user.useConfigOnly = true`


## Why you need this

There can be many reasons why you want to use several git identities. It could be either because you want to separate work and personal stuff (see e.g. [here](https://blog.stevenocchipinti.com/2016/12/28/different-author-email-addresses-per-git-repository/) or [here](https://collectiveidea.com/blog/archives/2016/04/04/multiple-personalities-in-git)), or you are using the private commit email feature the git forges introduced to hide your real email from commits (e.g. on [GitHub](https://github.blog/2017-04-11-private-emails-now-more-private/) and on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/help/user/profile/index?target=_blank#private-commit-email)).

This means you will have at least one identity per git forge, plus a local one for local-only repos. It also means that you can not use a global user identity configured in your `~/.gitconfig` since the user and email ids will need to be different for each working copy.

If you consult your favourite git forge's documentation on how to use the private commit email feature, it will likely tell you to use the `git config [--global] user.email "email@example.com"` command to set it either for the current repo, or globally. Globally is ruled out, since you may want a different one for each working copy (see previous paragraphs).

Practically, this means that you would need to issue a `git config user.email` command after cloning. But what if you don't/forget? If you still have a global user id configured in your `~/.gitconfig`, it gets worse, because git will silently use that if the working copy configuration (`.git/config`) doesn't specify user and email ids of its own.

To give you a prod to not forget setting the proper user and email ids, helpful souls have introduced the [user.useConfigOnly](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config?source=post_page---------------------------#Documentation/git-config.txt-useruseConfigOnly) parameter, which you set in `~/.gitconfig`. This will cause git to refuse commits and pushes the working copy configuration in `.git/config` doesn't specify user and email ids of its own.

Now you're safe to no accidentally use your real (or the wrong) email address for commits. But manually issue a `git config user.email` command **every time after you clone a repo.** And what was my alias email on forge *X* again? If you search the interwebs for solutions, you will find many variations of schemes based on [`include`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config?source=post_page---------------------------#_includes), [`includeIf`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config?source=post_page---------------------------#_conditional_includes), or [`alias`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config?source=post_page---------------------------#Documentation/git-config.txt-alias) git configuration options. To add a `include` section you will need to edit the `.git/config` file. `includeIf` can only check for the path of the working copy, or for the current branch; this may or may not work with your way of organising things. `alias` finally will force you to remember many new commands.

This is where `gituser` comes into play. It automates all of this, presents you with sensible options, lets you choose one of them quickly, and updates the working copy configuration in `.git/config` for you. The magic is that `gituser` consults a little database of identities (which described below) you set up once, and matches the remotes configured in the working copy against those. Pick one, hit enter, job done. The good thing: you can run `gituser` as many times as you want on each working copy to switch to a different identity should you need to.


## How to use it


### Installation

1.  Copy or clone the `gituser` script to a directory that's in your `PATH`
2.  `cpanm File::HomeDir Path::Class Path::Class::Iterator Config::GitLike::Git Text::TabularDisplay IO::Prompter`

That's all.


### Configuration

1.  `mkdir -p ~/.git/id`
2.  Create a file named `~/.git/id/local` that contains a git configuration file section with the user and email ids you want to use for local repos:

        [user]
             name = John Doe
             email = j.doe@gmail.com
3.  Repeat step 2 for each git forge account you have, and name the files in the `/.git/id` according to the naming convention username@forge (for example `jdoe@github.com`).
4.  [Optional] You can use symbolic links to use the same ids for more than one account.


### Using it

-   Example 1: local id

        example$ git init
        Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/repo/.git/

        example$ gituser
        No remotes configured. Using local id from /home/jdoe/.git/id/local.
        Setting git user id from /home/jdoe/.git/id/local
-   Example 2: matching remote

        example$ git clone git@github.com:c-alpha/gituser.git
        Cloning into 'gituser'...
        remote: Enumerating objects: 6, done.
        remote: Counting objects: 100% (6/6), done.
        remote: Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
        remote: Total 6 (delta 1), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
        Receiving objects: 100% (6/6), 4.23 KiB | 4.23 MiB/s, done.
        Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.

        example$ cd gituser

        example$ gituser
        Found 1 remote for which you have configured a user ID:
        +--------+-----------------+
        | remote | ID              |
        +--------+-----------------+
        | origin | jdoe@github.com |
        +--------+-----------------+
        Select remote (TAB completes/cycles) [origin]: origin
        Setting git user id from /home/jdoe/.git/id/jdoe@github.com

    This example shows two features.

    First, the script supports one account per git forge only. If you need more than one account for one and the same got forge, please create an issue with a feature request.

    Secondly, if there is a remote cunningly called `origin`, it is offered as the default at the prompt. I.e. in the above example you will simply have to hit the Enter key to select the `origin` remote. For all other remotes, the prompt offers `TAB` completion.

Voil√°, that's all.
